Bazel rules for jOOQ codegen from Flyway migrations
===================================================

This Bazel rule will apply Flyway migrations to a database
launched in a Testcontainer, use those to run jOOQ's code
generator, and produce a source JAR containing your generated
classes.


More detailed documentation is coming soon.
